# Sens-O-Matic

> "The history of every major Galactic civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry, and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why, and Where phases. For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question 'How can we eat?', the second by the question 'Why do we eat?', and the third by the question 'Where shall we have lunch?'"

## Don't Panic!

Planning social gatherings with friends shouldn't be harder than calculating the probability of being rescued from deep space (which, for the record, is 2^276,709 to 1 against). Yet somehow, the simple act of coordinating "let's grab drinks" often involves more back-and-forth messages than a Vogon bureaucracy permit application.

## The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Getting Together

Sens-O-Matic is a social planning library that makes spontaneous hangouts as easy as falling off a log. Or more accurately, as easy as falling through space (which, as any hitchhiker knows, is remarkably easy - the trick is learning how to miss the ground).

The entire process requires just a few button clicks. No committees. No endless group chats. No planning paralysis. Just pure, distilled social coordination.

## The Journey Through Hyperspace (How It Works)

### Phase 1: Wanting
*Initial state - Like Arthur Dent wanting a proper cup of tea*

Bob feels like grabbing a drink. He opens the app, which starts in the "Wanting" state. He checks a few boxes about what he's in the mood for (drinks, dinner, games) or selects "up for anything" - the pangalactic gargleblaster of social options.

### Phase 2: Pinging
*Broadcasting across the sub-ether network*

Bob sends out a ping to his friend group. The message travels faster than bad news through the cosmos, reaching all his friends who have the app installed.

### Phase 3: Quiescing
*The Vogon Poetry Reading Period (but mercifully shorter)*

There's a brief settling period where interested folks can respond. Think of it as the opposite of a Vogon poetry reading - people actually want to participate. Anyone who doesn't respond is marked as unavailable (they're probably stuck in a bypass planning meeting).

### Phase 4: When (Temporal Coordination)
*Easier than time travel, harder than missing the ground*

The app presents everyone with Bob's initial time preference. Friends can agree or propose alternatives. After another brief settling period, the system employs advanced strategies:
- "Closest to mine" - For the temporally selfish
- "Most popular" - Democracy in action
- "Must include Ford and Zaphod" - For when specific froods are essential

Bob picks the winning time. The Infinite Improbability Drive has nothing on this level of coordination.

### Phase 5: Where (Location Triangulation)
*Now with 42% less confusion*

Bob gets first dibs on location selection, presented with intelligent strategies:
- "Closest to me" - The Zaphod Beeblebrox approach
- "Geographic center" - Fair and balanced, like a properly toweled hitchhiker
- "Has Pan-Galactic Gargle Blasters" - Feature-based selection
- "Not in Vogon territory" - Avoidance zones

Bob can choose a strategy or open it up to the group. The strategies generate candidate locations, building a list of possibilities (top 10, because even Deep Thought needs limits).

### Phase 6: Voting
*More democratic than the Galactic Government*

Everyone participates in ranked choice voting for the location list generated in Phase 5. The app handles tie-breaking automatically after a timeout. No need for Marvin's depressing input or a committee forming a committee to decide how to form a committee. This sophisticated voting system works better than any Galactic presidential election.

### Phase 7: RSVP
*Final boarding call for the Heart of Gold*

The final What/Where/When is sent as an invite. Options include minimum attendance requirements - if fewer than N people RSVP, the intent fails and everyone tries again another time (probably when Earth hasn't been demolished for a hyperspace bypass).

## Key Features (Mostly Harmless)

- **Babel Fish Simplicity**: Universally understandable interface
- **Deep Thought Strategies**: Intelligent decision algorithms for every phase
- **Marvin-Proof**: Designed to work even when everything seems pointless
- **Towel Compatible**: Always know where your towel is (location services)
- **Bypass Resistant**: No committee can stop a plan once in motion

## Future Enhancements (Currently at Marklar IV)

- Late joining for fashionably late arrivals
- Multi-group coordination (for when your different circles overlap like badly drawn Venn diagrams)
- Historic pattern learning (the app remembers that Trillian always votes for wine bars)

## Technical Guide for Hitchhikers

### Building the Probability Drive

```bash
cargo build           # Construct the Heart of Gold
cargo build --release # With infinite improbability optimization
```

### Testing the Sub-Ether Circuits

```bash
cargo test                    # Test all components
cargo test test_name          # Test specific component
cargo test -- --nocapture     # See the dolphins' goodbye messages
```

### Formatting and Linting (Keeping it Zarquon Clean)

```bash
cargo fmt              # Format code to Galactic standards
cargo clippy           # Let the ship's computer critique your code
```

## Architecture (The Encyclopedia Galactica Entry)

The library implements a typestate pattern that would make even Slartibartfast proud. Each state transition is enforced at compile time - preventing impossible states more effectively than the laws of physics prevent faster-than-light travel (which, as we know, they don't really).

### Core Modules

- **`who`**: Participant modeling (currently as empty as space)
- **`what`**: Activities and moods (from Coffee to Pan-Galactic Gargle Blasters)
- **`where`**: Location services (in development, currently lost like Zaphod's second head)
- **`when`**: Temporal coordination (handles everything except actual time travel)

## Dependencies

- **chrono**: For time handling (because even in an infinite universe, timing matters)

## Contributing

If you'd like to help make spontaneous social planning a reality, grab your towel and join us. We promise the code reviews are nothing like Vogon poetry readings.

## License

This project is about as free as a hitchhiker floating through space - which is to say, very free indeed, within the constraints of whatever license we eventually choose.
