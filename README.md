# Sens-O-Matic

A mobile app for coordinating spontaneous meetups with friends.

## The Problem

Getting friends together for drinks shouldn't require a group chat with 47 messages. The real friction isn't finding who's available - it's finding the overlap of *when* people can be there and *where* works for everyone.

- "I'm free but not if it's downtown"
- "I can make it but only after 5:30"
- "Is anyone still going to be there at 7?"

Sens-O-Matic helps groups find that overlap quickly.

## How It Works

### 1. Ping

Someone asks: "Who's up for drinks today?"

This goes out to your group. No need to pick a time or place yet.

### 2. Gather

People respond with:
- **Yes or No** - Commit or don't. No maybes.
- **When** - Their availability window (e.g., "4pm - 7pm")
- **Where preferences** - How far they'll travel, areas they like, the vibe they want

Changed your mind? No problem:
- Said yes? You can cancel (the group sees you're no longer coming)
- Said no? You can join later (if there's space at the venue)

### 3. Match

The app finds places that work for the group based on:
- Everyone's location and distance limits
- Preferred areas and styles
- Group favorites vs. trying somewhere new

It shows a timeline of who's planning to be there when, so you know if it's worth showing up late.

## Place Data

Sens-O-Matic uses a hybrid approach:
- **Group favorites** - Places your crew knows and likes
- **Discovery** - New spots from external sources based on your filters

## Concepts

- **Group** - Your circle of friends who might join hangouts
- **Ping** - An open invitation to gauge interest
- **Availability** - When someone can be there (start time, end time)
- **Preferences** - Where constraints (distance, area, style)

## Status

Early development. Concept phase.
